# Makeureuh
Makefile generator

### Installing
You don't actually need to install it, just clone the directory.

### Usage
This script is really easy to use, all you need is making ./Gen.sh executable
(chmod u+x ./Gen.sh), then running it.

The makefile will be generated in a file called "Generated_Makefile"

## TODO
- Adding new languages

Good luck!
